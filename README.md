## Abstract

OceanRed is a portmanteau word which is the blend of  **EnOcean**  and **Infrared**.
OceanRed is an embedded device that serves as a universal infrared controller that works as an interface between EnOcean protocoll and Infrared protocoll.  This is based on the ESP32-WROVER-B developed by „Espressif“ and uses the EnOcean TCM515 Modul (radio modul) for EnOcean Communication. This device embeddes a single-page application (SPA) developed with Angular framework, this Angular webpage enables the user to configure the device and to send Infrared signals.
